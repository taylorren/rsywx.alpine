# RSYWX V7

I have been working on my personal book collection [site](https://rsywx.net) since [Symfony 2.x](https://symfony.com/). And ever since then, I have always sticked to it and upgrade my site from time to time. 

I have used other frameworks like Vue, React and (current before this) Svelte. 

Now I will start another one with the following tech frameworks:

1. Symfony 6.*
2. Alpine.js 3.*

I want to combine my familiar Symfony development with the "reactivity" provided by Alpine. 

So, this is it.
